# Generalizable Hearthstone Agent
This repository is the official implementation of *Integrating Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning for Generalization in Strategic Card Games*.

## Overview
This repository presents a novel framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tackle generalization challenges in strategic card games like Hearthstone. By leveraging a fine-tuned T5-base model and integrating it into a self-play RL training pipeline, the framework enhances policy learning efficiency and zero-shot generalization capabilities in dynamic, language-rich environments.
